#  GUI for plant species classification with built-in mahcine learning methods 

The objective of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to effciently classify 99 plant species by
using their binary leaf images including shape, margin & texture and pixel level information. This problem
also provides a valuable opportunity to directly implement programming tools to tackle unsolved engineering
problems. Furthermore, the methods this work is based on can be applied to various engineering domains
due to the applicability nature of machine learning.
