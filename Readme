Plant species classificaion is not only the job for botanists and plant ecologists. It is applicable and required
by many parts of society, from professionals (such as landscape architects, foresters, farmers, conservationists,
and biologists) to the general public (like ecotourists, hikers, and nature lovers). However, the traditional
classification methods require rich experience and fund of knowledge, which could be really time-consuming
and confusing for beginners. There are also high possibilities of misidentification for those methods. Nowa-
days image-based plant phenotyping is a growing area for application of computer vision in agriculture
domain. In the world, there are half a million species of plants. It is always on high demand to realize plant
automatic recognition with high efficiency and accuracy.

Over the past decade the inherent multi-disciplinarity of machine learning has been widely recognized. One of
the important types of machine learning: supervised learning, plays an important role in image recognition.[1]
In the meantime, leaf can be a remarkable feature in plant species classification. Therefore, it is meaningful
to create a well-modeled classification algorithm making use of the morphological and color properties of
various leaves.

The objective of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to effciently classify 99 plant species by
using their binary leaf images including shape, margin & texture and pixel level information. This problem
also provides a valuable opportunity to directly implement programming tools to tackle unsolved engineering
problems. Furthermore, the methods this work is based on can be applied to various engineering domains
due to the applicability nature of machine learning.
